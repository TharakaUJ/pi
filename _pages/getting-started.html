    <p>As a newbie to Raspberry Pi, You may already have many questions. After reading this article, you'll find some answers to that.
    </p>

    <p>The Raspberry Pi is a low-cost, credit-card-sized computer also capable of doing almost everything we do on a regular desktop computer.
    </p>      
    <p>Let's first look at what Raspberry Pi you should buy and how to set up the Pi.
    </p>      
    <p>Since you are new to Raspberry Pi, let's take the easiest way to set it up. For other methods of setting up a Pi, look for the other tutorials on this site.
    </p>   
    <p>One additional advantage of Raspberry Pies is that you can experiment with them as you want.
      You can try anything without risking the cost of hardware as experimenting with pcs.

  <h4>What Raspberry Pi to buy?
  </h4>
  <p>There are several types of Raspberry Pis. But the most popular one is the RPi 4 model B. It is the latest, fastest, and most user-friendly RPi. The RPi with RAM 2GB is more than enough for most use cases.
  </p>

  <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">This is an RPi 4. image reference: ranspberrypi.org</span></p>
  <p>There are smaller RPi versions too. Raspberry Pi is one such version. Since the power consumption of smaller RPis is lower, those are suitable for building robots.
  </p>
  <p>But since RPi 4 is easy to use, you can build the prototype with it and then use a smaller version in production.

  <h4>Other things you want.
  </h4>

  <ul>
    <li><span>A micro SD card
    <br />In RPis, files and OS both saved on to the SD card. IT acts as the hard drive for RPi.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/2023/04/sd-card-e1682429198583-300x220.png" width="170" height="125" alt=""/></span></p>
    <p><span>The SD card should be at least 8GB in size. There are SD cards that are already set up with RPi Os too.</span></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Key board and mouse<br />You will need a USB Keyboard to set up the RPi.
    <br />After the setup, you can also use a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.</li>
    <li>a TV or a Monitor<br />Since RPis don't have screens, you have to connect a monitor.
      If the screen has built-in speakers, it can also play sounds.</li>
    <li><span>      If you don't have a monitor, set your RPi in the.<a href="https://pi.lk/uncategorized/headless-raspberry-pi-set-up/">headless method</a></span></li>
    <li>HDMI<br />There is an HDMI port in your RPi. Most of the new TVs and monitors work with HDMI.
    <br />There are two Micro HDMI ports in RPi 4. Therefore RPi 4 can connect to two monitors.
    <br />You will need a micro HDMI to HDMI cable or an adapter to connect RPi 4 to a screen.<br />RPi 1,2 and 3 have full-size HDMI ports.  So You can use a standard HDMI to HDMI cable for connecting a screen.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span>HDMI port of a RPi 3.</span><br /><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/2023/04/raspberrypi3-HDMI-port-e1682432577215.png" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>DVI<br />If Your screen has a DVI port, use a HDMI to DVI cable.</li>
    <li>VGA<br />Some screens have VGA ports. In that case, You can use HDMI to VGA adapter.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additional Equipment.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>A Protective Case.
    <br />This is not mandatory but good for the protection of your RPi.
    </li>
    <li>Headphones or speakers.
    <br />Bigger versions of RPis(except versions like RPi Zero) have audio ports. As I said earlier, if the screen has built-in speakers, those also can play sound.
    </li>
    <li>Ethernet cable
    <br />Bigger versions of RPi have Standard ethernet ports. For RPi like RPi Zero, a USB to Ethernet adapter can be used.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The RPi 3, 4, and Zero can connect to the internet via Wifi.</p>

  <h4>Set up your SD card.
  </h4>
    <p><span>Since your sd card doesn't have the RPi OS installed yet, let's install the OS easily.</span></p>
    <h4><span><strong>Let's install the RPi OS through Raspberry Pi Imager.</strong></span></h4>
    <p><span>This is the easiest way to install the OS. And note that, RPi OS is not the only  OS you can install on an RPi. RPi imager also provides several  OSs to install.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Download and Launch Raspberry Pi Imager.</strong></p>
    <p><span>Go to the<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">Raspberry Pi Downloads</a> page.</span></p>
    <p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/2023/04/Screenshot-from-2023-04-25-08.45.50@2x-e1682392684189.png" /></p>
    <p><span>Click the download link suitable for your PC.</span></p>
    <p><span>After the download, click on the Imager icon and launch it. Connect your SD card to your PC using an adapter.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Use of RPi imager.</strong><br /><span>When formatting the SD card using the Imager, the files already on the SD card get overwritten. Therefore don't forget to back up your Sd card before formatting.</span></p>
    <p><span>Sometimes your PC's OS can prevent you from running the Imager. For example, the following message can appear in a Windows OS.</span></p>
    <p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/2023/04/Screenshot-from-2023-04-25-08.49.14@2x-e1682392827650.png" /></p>
    <p><span>If this message appears, click more info and then click run anyway.</span><br /><span>Install and run the Imager by following the instructions.</span></p>
    <p><span>Insert your Sd card into your PC, and in the Imager, select the OS you want to install and select the inserted SD card.</span><br><span>Note:  For the first time, the RPi imager has to download the OS you selected. Therefore you have to have an internet connection.
      Then that downloaded version is cached to the Imager and can be used while offline.</span></p>
    <p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/2023/04/Screenshot-from-2023-04-25-00.11.55@2x-1.png" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span>Next, click the write button.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span>Wait until the writing finishes.</span><br /><span>When the below message appears, you can eject the SD card.</span></p>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/2023/04/Screenshot-from-2023-04-25-00.37.13@2x-e1682392924100.png" /> </p>

  <h4>Connect the Raspberry PI
  </h4>
<p><span>Let's connect other items to your RPi.</span><br /><span>It is crucial to connect each device to the corresponding port.</span><span></span></p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p><span>This is an RPi 3.<br /><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/2023/04/labelled-rasberry-pi3.png" /></span></p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p><span>This is an RPi 4.</span><br /></span><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/2023/04/labelled-rasberry-pi4.png" /><span></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>Insert your already set up micro SD card.<strong>Its slot will be on the other side of the RPi board.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Connect your mouse to a USB port. (connect to any USB port)</span></p>
<p><span>Similarly, connect the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>Switch on the screen you are hoping to connect. Connect the screen to the HDMI port in RPi. Use an adapter if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: There are two HDMI ports in some RPis, like RPi 4.</span><br /><span>In that case, connect the screen to the port named HDMI0. (In RPi 4, that port will be next to the power in port.)</span><br /><span>Then you can connect a second screen also if you want.</span></p>
<p><span>For RPi 1,2,3, there will be only one HDMI port. Connect the screen to that port.</span></p>
<p><span>Since RPi is still off, You won't see anything on the screen yet.</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to connect the RPi to the internet via ethernet, connect the ethernet port of the RPi using an ethernet cable. Connect the other side of the ethernet cable to a router or an ethernet socket.</span><br /><span>If you are using wifi or not going to use the internet at all, you can skip the Ethernet port.</span></p>
<p><span>If the screen has built-in speakers, you can play sound through those. Otherwise, you can also connect headphones or speakers.</span></p>
