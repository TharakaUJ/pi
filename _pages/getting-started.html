    <p>As a newbie to Raspberry Pi, You may already have many questions. After reading this article, you'll find some answers to that.
    </p>

    <p>The Raspberry Pi is a low-cost, credit-card-sized computer also capable of doing almost everything we do on a regular desktop computer.
    </p>      
    <p>Let's first look at what Raspberry Pi you should buy and how to set up the Pi.
    </p>      
    <p>Since you are new to Raspberry Pi, let's take the easiest way to set it up. For other methods of setting up a Pi, look for the other tutorials on this site.
    </p>   
    <p>One additional advantage of Raspberry Pies is that you can experiment with them as you want.
      You can try anything without risking the cost of hardware as experimenting with pcs.

  <h4>What Raspberry Pi to buy?
  </h4>
  <p>There are several types of Raspberry Pis. But the most popular one is the RPi 4 model B. It is the latest, fastest, and most user-friendly RPi. The RPi with RAM 2GB is more than enough for most use cases.

  <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">This is an RPi 4. image reference: ranspberrypi.org</span></p>
  <p>There are smaller RPi versions too. Raspberry Pi is one such version. Since the power consumption of smaller RPis is lower, those are suitable for building robots.
  </p>
  <p>But since RPi 4 is easy to use, you can build the prototype with it and then use a smaller version in production.

  <h4>Other things you want.
  </h4>

  <ul>
    <li><span>A micro SD card
    <br />In RPis, files and OS both saved on to the SD card. IT acts as the hard drive for RPi.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/2023/04/sd-card-e1682429198583-300x220.png" width="170" height="125" alt=""/></span></p>
    <p><span>The SD card should be at least 8GB in size. There are SD cards that are already set up with RPi Os too.</span></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Key board and mouse<br />You will need a USB Keyboard to set up the RPi.
    <br />After the setup, you can also use a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.</li>
    <li>a TV or a Monitor<br />Since RPis don't have screens, you have to connect a monitor.
      If the screen has built-in speakers, it can also play sounds.</li>
    <li><span>      If you don't have a monitor, set your RPi in the.<a href="https://pi.lk/uncategorized/headless-raspberry-pi-set-up/">headless method</a></span></li>
    <li>HDMI<br />There is an HDMI port in your RPi. Most of the new TVs and monitors work with HDMI.
    <br />There are two Micro HDMI ports in RPi 4. Therefore RPi 4 can connect to two monitors.
    <br />You will need a micro HDMI to HDMI cable or an adapter to connect RPi 4 to a screen.<br />RPi 1,2 and 3 have full-size HDMI ports.  So You can use a standard HDMI to HDMI cable for connecting a screen.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span>HDMI port of a RPi 3.</span><br /><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/2023/04/raspberrypi3-HDMI-port-e1682432577215.png" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>DVI<br />If Your screen has a DVI port, use a HDMI to DVI cable.</li>
    <li>VGA<br />Some screens have VGA ports. In that case, You can use HDMI to VGA adapter.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additional Equipment.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>A Protective Case.
    <br />This is not mandatory but good for the protection of your RPi.
    </li>
    <li>Headphones or speakers.
    <br />Bigger versions of RPis(except versions like RPi Zero) have audio ports. As I said earlier, if the screen has built-in speakers, those also can play sound.
    </li>
    <li>Ethernet cable
    <br />Bigger versions of RPi have Standard ethernet ports. For RPi like RPi Zero, a USB to Ethernet adapter can be used.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The RPi 3, 4, and Zero can connect to the internet via Wifi.</p>
